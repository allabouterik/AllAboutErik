Erik Jacobsen is an American record producer, song publisher, and artists manager, born May 19, 1940 in Oak Park Illinois on the west side of Chicago. His early musical influences were wide ranging, including a unique opportunity of listening to the first urban radio stations broadcasting polka, blues and country. He is best known for his work in the 1960s with Tim Hardin, The Lovin' Spoonful, The Charlatans, Sopwith Camel, and later with Norman Greenbaum and Chris Isaak.
