## MUSICIAN

In high school he played the tuba and sousaphone.  Later, at Oberlin College he began playing bluegrass style banjo and by his senior year, took over leadership of the Oberlin bluegrass band, The Plumb Creek Boys.  After graduation in 1962, he formed the The Knob Lick Upper 10,000, with Dwain Story and Peter Childs, also Oberlin graduates. They performed at The Bitter End coffee house in New York City, where they were signed by manager Albert Grossman. They recorded two albums for Mercury Records, Introducing The Knob Lick Upper 10,000 (1962), and Work Out!!! (1963), and were among the first folk and bluegrass artists to play Carnegie Hall.

In 1964, after hearing The Beatles, Jacobsen quit The Knob Lick Upper 10,000, intending to produce records combining folk music instruments with electric instruments and drums.

Returning to New York, he soon met John Sebastian, who had similar ideas, and they began working with other musicians, including Jerry Yester, Zal Yanovsky, Jesse Colin Young, Cass Elliott and Denny Doherty. Jacobsen produced various demos for different combinations of these musicians, prototypes of the folk rock style, some of which were issued on the 1966 Elektra album What's Shakin', and others on a 1999 compilation The Magic Circle.

## THE LOVIN' SPOONFUL

Starting in 1965, Jacobsen produced the albums Do You Believe in Magic, Daydream, and Hums of the Lovin' Spoonful, which yielded seven straight top-10 singles, including "Do You Believe in Magic," "You Didn't Have to Be So Nice," "Daydream," and the number one hit, "Summer in the City,"  which was subsequently voted the number one summertime single of the 20th century by BillBoard Magazine. The Lovin’ Spoonful also recorded soundtracks for Woody Allen’s first movie What’s Up Tiger Lily as well as Francis Ford Coppola’s You’re a Big Boy Now. Jacobsen published the band's original songs through his Faithful Virtue Publishing Company and was a major factor in their development. Sebastian has said, "I felt like Erik, just as a collaborator, was a fifth member of the Spoonful" (Interview with John Sebastian by Lewis Shiner, 8 Jan 2012).

## TIM HARDIN

Jacobsen discovered singer-songwriter Tim Hardin in 1964, began working as his manager and produced his first album, Tim Hardin 1.  The album includes modern classics like "Reason to Believe," "Misty Roses," "Don't Make Promises" and "How Can We Hang on to a Dream." To encourage Hardin to write original songs, Jacobsen bought him a tape recorder and paid him $50 for every song Hardin recorded that had at least two verses and a chorus [liner notes to the original version of "Hang on to a Dream: The Verve Recordings". Songs that Hardin later recorded as demos for Jacobsen also include "If I Were a Carpenter" and others that appeared on Tim Hardin 2. Hardin's songs were published through Faithful Virtue Music Company (Tim Hardin Songs & Poetry by Tim Hardin 1968). In 1965 Jacobsen also produced the original blues style recordings that were eventually later released as Tim Hardin 4 on Verve Records.

## OTHER ARTISTS

Jacobsen expanded his search for talent to California and worked there with the first of the newly emerging San Francisco rock bands, The Charlatans. While having little recording success, the band served as a launching pad for the extraordinary songwriter and singer, Dan Hicks, composer of the iconic song “I Scare Myself,” among many others.  In 1966 Jacobsen recorded the group Sopwith Camel, their song “Hello Hello” was the first pop hit to come out of San Francisco’s psychedelic era.

In 1968 Jacobsen began working with singer songwriter, Brian Elliot. One album was released by Warner Brothers Records. In the late 1970’s the Elliot/Jacobsen Publishing Company had their song “Papa Don’t Preach” covered by Madonna. Her record went on to become an international number one hit, selling over one hundred million copies. Elliot and Jacobsen have continued to work together recently, in 2014, releasing an album, Mr. Brian Elliot, which can be heard on his [website](http://www.mrbrianelliot.com/).

In 1969 Jacobsen produced and published the song “Mill Valley”, a number one Adult Contemporary hit for Rita Abrams, a kindergarten school teacher, singing with the Strawberry Point School Third Grade Class. They were featured on the cover of Life Magazine and were guests on the Smother’s Brothers TV show. For more information about Abrams and to watch the video of the song, made by Francis Ford Coppola visit  [www.ritaabrams.com](www.ritaabrams.com).

In 1968, Jacobsen began working with Norman Greenbaum. They made three albums together. "Spirit in the Sky"  became a #1 worldwide hit that went on to be one of the most licensed recordings of all time, in over 30 films, and many TV shows and commercials.

In 1980-1984 he produced two albums with the San Francisco ska and reggae oriented band, The Tazmanian Devils (Warner Brothers records).

In 1981 he teamed up with Chris Isaak, as producer, publisher and manager. They worked and toured together through 1998, making five albums, including the double Platinum album Heart Shaped World. The break through single, “Wicked Game,” was eventually made into a music video, which has been voted one of MTV’s sexiest male video of all time. Isaak’s music has also been featured in numerous movies, TV shows and advertisements.

Though semi-retired, Jacobsen continues to manage many of his published songs and masters for various uses.
