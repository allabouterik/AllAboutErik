          I wrote the song and recorded it under the stage name of Little Peetie
          Love, don’t ask me why. Jack Holzman actually considered releasing it
          but look at the letter of rejection he sent me.

          Jerry Yester did a great job on a song I wrote. We recorded several
          other songs together. I think Henry Diltz and some other pals sang
          backup.

          My old partner Dwain Story sang on a song I wrote called "A Little
          Lovin". I'm pretty sure some guys from The Spoonful backed him up on
          this one.

          The first of John’s songs we recorded together was called Rooty Toot,
          a song he had written as a teenager with his cousin. The two of us
          went into the studio. John played guitar, harp, and sang lead vocal.
          We had some vocal backup singers and we put on chimes and clapped.

          This was the demo version we recorded of John’s first composition,
          written shortly before we got the spoonful going.

When I came off the road with the Knoblick Upper 10,000, I settled down in Greenwich Village in 1964 to write songs, look for artists, and make records
