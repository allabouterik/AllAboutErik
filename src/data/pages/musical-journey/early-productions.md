          I wrote the song and recorded it under the stage name of Little Peetie
          Love, donâ€™t ask me why. Jack Holzman actually considered releasing it
          but look at the letter of rejection he sent me.

          Jerry Yester did a great job on a song I wrote. We recorded several
          other songs together. I think Henry Diltz and some other pals sang
          backup.

          My old partner Dwain Story sang on a song I wrote called "A Little
          Lovin". I'm pretty sure some guys from The Spoonful backed him up on
          this one.

When I came off the road with the Knoblick Upper 10,000, I settled down in Greenwich Village in 1964 to write songs, look for artists, and make records
