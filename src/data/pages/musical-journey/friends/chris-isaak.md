Finding Chris was a lucky break for me. I was looking for someone with real star potential, and when I first went to see his band I was impressed. I was surprised to hear them playing rockabilly sounding material. They had some originals and did some covers. Chris looked great, and he was giving the performance his all. He hadn’t been singing that long, and was obviously doing some of the songs in the wrong key, and trying for some notes that he just couldn’t hit. But his voice sounded great. Jimmy Wilsey, the guitarist, was a unique and talented stylist, and his playing worked perfectly with what Chris was doing. The whole group was sporting 50s style garb. When Chris and I talked after the show I was very impressed with the guy. He was bright, funny, and well-spoken, and came across as a determined, centered, and decisive guy.



What a wardrobe he had! As I later discovered, his closet was filled with great old 40's and 50's clothes. Beautiful fabrics, pleated pants, dress shirts, jackets, and even matching belts and socks. He was one sartorial looking dude when he dressed up. I later learned he had inherited his style from his mom, Dorothy.



I began going to their gigs as they played around town. After many conversations and much discussion, Chris and I decided to work together. We took the band into the studio to make some demos but they didn’t come out that well. So we agreed to sack the rhythm section and hold auditions to try and find a stronger unit. 



 A talent scout from Warners, Felix Chamberlin, came to see the group and brought his critique back to the company. Terrible songs, the singer can’t sing, guitar player sucks, and the band is raggedy and loose. But fate intervened, and with the help of an incredible string of positive fortune cookies that I got at late night dinners in Chinatown with Chris, and which I subsequently sent to Michael Ostin at Warner’s (which you can see below.), we finally got signed and began recording our first album. 



The finished product didn’t go over well here in the states but was well received in Europe, and we toured there. Everyone wanted to hear the band and every journalist hoped to talk to Chris. He could be a very charming guy and did great interviews. He essentially wrote their articles for them. In Paris, he did eight hours straight with 15-minute interviews back to back all day long. The French PR girl had never seen anything like it, especially with American musicians. I asked Chris how he did it, and he said I just get them talking about themselves. 



I went with him on promotional forays many times. Once his clothes went on to Africa when he and I got off in Madrid. With minutes to spare, the clothes arrived, and we sped across town to a major TV show WB had booked. He changed in the back seat, combed his hair, and dashed into the studio and onto the stage just as the announcer said, “And now presenting Chris Isaak.” In Paris, we celebrated hard in a restaurant with the WB guys there, and at the end of the meal, the president of the company climbed onto the table and did a rendition of “Singing In the Rain” while pouring a bottle of water over his head. In Amsterdam, we were drinking Genever after a big dinner with the whole Warner’s crew, and there too, the president climbed up on the table and we all toasted drunkenly. Big fun! In Uncle Po’s in Hamburg, there were 400 journalists in the audience, a full house. It seemed like each was smoking two Gauloises at once. It was so smokey you could hardly see the stage. Everyone got sick afterward. 



Chris and I headed to Stockholm. He was booked on yet another huge TV show, which was watched by every person in Scandinavia, called the Saturday Night Massacre. It was a variety show. The principals were all comedians. Three Swedes and a Norwegian. Running through Chris’s song “Gone Riding,” the four hosts planned to sit on big Harleys parked on stage and pretend they were trying to hitch a ride. Chris came to me and said “Let’s get out of here. These assholes are making fun of my songs. I told the lady director we had a problem, and she said, “fine, feel free to leave.” Chris and I discussed the situation in the dressing room. It wasn’t good! He didn’t feel well, but I convinced him to at least see what else they had in mind for him to do. Out in the studio, everyone in the crew was bummed out, pissed, and disappointed. The ambiance was like death warmed over. Their other idea was to have Chris play live with the house band. Chris was negative and dismissive of the prospect, but he did agree to take his guitar out and meet the band. The guitar player had a white model of a famous old guitar with gold hardware. Chris was impressed by the guitar, and when the players told him that they had worked up several of his songs, Chris was like, ok, let's hear one. They broke into “Gone Ridin” with such swinging finesse that Chris, who was somewhat taken aback, began to play along. They sounded terrific together, and when they were done, everyone in the studio cheered. They played "Gone Ridin" on the show that night, and leaving Sweden the next day, everyone at the airport stopped him and said hi. Every person in Scandinavia had seen the show and loved it. Who were those musicians that had saved the day for us? Abba’s number one hit-making instrumental studio recording unit. 



Chris was always promoting. Take a look at the postcards he sent to various people from the road. He sent hundreds. He and Kenny worked out a two-man acoustic set and they staged numerous live musical promo presentations. The concerts were all sold out. Everybody loved the group in Europe. 



Back in San Francisco, he had developed a loyal and stylish group of fans that filled the clubs everywhere that he played. For a time, many members of the audience looked like they all were wearing 50's getups for Halloween. Gals with gloves, hats, and handbags, tiny waists and full skirts. Poodle Skirts, chiffon scarves, tight sweaters, petty coats, some bullet bras, and ruby red lipstick. The guys wore full cut suits, pleated pants, and sported pompadour dos. Everyone looked terrific. What a scene these concerts were! 



We kept recording. He’d make tapes of 20 or 30 song starts. Some sounded great right off, but together we’d decide which others merited further work. Everyone was convinced that Chris was a star. But we couldn’t get that breakthrough hit. The songs and recordings were all good but where was the chart topper? 



Meanwhile Chris and I lightheartedly discussed fallback plans to achieve financial success outside the music biz if need be. We had inventions to market. The“Shark Buster”. These small units would be affixed to your wet suit, exuding toxins from a poisonous type sole into the surrounding water to repel sharks. Chris was surfing in white shark country. The “Dash Buddy”. A stick on barrier that keeps items from sliding off your dash board. And the “Fling-a-Ling”. A long slim rectangular styrofoam object that returns to you boomerang style when thrown. Luckily, we never had to pursue these avenues. 



Chris had boxed golden gloves in Japan before he decided to pursue a career in music, and he had lifted a lot of weights. Generally speaking, he was very calm and composed, but he wasn’t a guy you wanted to push too far. Ask the jerk in the men’s room at the club in Berkeley. Chris was applying one of the several layers of pomade he used on his pomp, and the guy made a disparaging reference to his masculinity. Chris asked him to repeat himself, and when he did, one quick punch put him on the floor under the urinals. A guy who worked with the group on the road had some gripe and unwisely decided to hold all the stage outfits hostage. Bad idea, and when words, reason and a warning failed to settle the dispute, Chris was forced to resort to a more persuasive solution. He got the suits back tout de suite. 



With the release of our third album, the promo guys at Warner’s, as always, were unenthusiastic about it’s potential commercial success. Generally speaking, those guys couldn’t recognize a hit if it came up and bit them. But the fantastic song “Wicked Game” was on that album and despite the general lack of vision on the part of the company, between David Lynch, Mark Chestnut, Mo, Herb Ritz, and me handing out payola (which Mo kindly gave) to independent promo men and program directors around the country, we finally got on the charts and got that hit. 



We kept going. Another album, more videos, more touring, new songs, and then back into the studio. I was getting burned out as both manager and producer. My partner Mark Plummer from the early days had quit long before. 



One night Chris brought a groupie back to the motel in Hollywood. She had had some experience in the business and she wanted my job. She was constantly dissing me to Chris, so I just said, “let her manage you, fuck this.” Jimmy was going through changes about playing with the band and quit. It was a big loss to the sound we had crafted together. Chris subsequently left his new gal manager and got another one. 



After our great Baja Sessions album came out, the advice he received from his new managers was that he turn up the volume and call the new project the “Loud Album.” Chris wanted to produce some sides himself. I thought the songs were weak and doing the rehearsals was a miserable experience, as were the sessions. Everything was a mess, and for me it was the worst time I’d ever had in my production career. I didn’t like the way it turned out. And to think I missed the best albacore fishing season in San Francisco history doing it! I was finished as producer. 



Chris attempted co-writing, but nothing was working. He stayed in contact with me, sending cordial greetings from the road. A year later he invited me to a rehearsal to hear some new tunes he and the band were working up. There was only one I thought showed any potential, and I passed on getting involved again. 



I saw Chris one last time at a show he did at the Hardly Strictly Blue Grass Festival. He was pleasant enough, but that was the last time I ever saw or heard from him again. All our years of friendship, the fun and satisfaction of working together, and the great sounding projects we did, all seemed forgotten. But we’d had our day. 



Chris is older now, still tours, and I assume still trying to make records. One thing I know for sure.  When he’s performing on stage, he’s giving it his all.
