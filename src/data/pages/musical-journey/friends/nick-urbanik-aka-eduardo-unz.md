I’m not sure how I first met Nick Urbanik, who later took the stage name of Eduardo Unz, but I had a rug collecting buddy at the time, John Phillips, who took me to see a group called “Rhythm and Noise,” and quite possibly I first met Nick there in that context. As it happened, my amigo John disappeared soon thereafter, and his car was found several years later left in the San Francisco Airport parking lot. He was eventually presumed murdered and his body disposed of by a local serial killer. But this crazy band, with its three players, Naut Humon, Nik Fault, and Rex Probe, was an all-electronic avant-garde experimental musical group that was pioneering synth and midi performances in San Francisco. Nick was inspired by the possibilities of using these devices, and when we met he convinced me he could do some great stuff along these lines production wise and persuaded me to help him realize his ambitions in recording in this gene. He was a stylish guy and in the colder weather, he wore oversized flasher style overcoats. He had a nice gal friend, and it was only later I learned he had maintained his relationship with her and a second woman at the same time. Neither knew about the other. 



At the time I was hanging out on Haight St. with Isaak and his band, who were doing a residency at the Nite Break, Nick hyped Kim and I on a club a few blocks down the street called the “Aub Zam Zam Room.” It was an art deco style bar run by an old guy named Bruno, who claimed he was the last of the Abyssinians. His mother lived upstairs from the bar. His vintage jukebox only contained classic 40s records. Herb Caen loved the place, and he loved Bruno for his skill at making martinis. Nick had warned us up front that Bruno could be a real curmudgeon. He considered hippies barbarians, and they were not welcome in his place. We went in together and taking one look at Nick’s overcoat, Bruno instantly threw him out. I ordered a white wine and he suggested I go to the fern bar down the street. I quickly changed my order to a martini. Kim got her’s for free. He loved beautiful girls, and occasionally let them dance on his bar.



When he began recording, Nick changed his name to Eduardo Unz. I liked the work he was doing but in truth, it was strange and different sounding stuff, and no one wanted to put his music out. 



In the next few years, Nick stayed at my house several times and was not feeling well.

His mom called me several years later and told me he had died.



Alcoholism. I never knew it was that bad.
