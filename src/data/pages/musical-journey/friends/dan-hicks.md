I first met Dan when I got involved with the Charlatans back in 1965. As a vocalist, he sang kind of flat in those days but was writing some great songs. His singing kept improving, and when the Charlatans split up, Dan started up with his own group, Dan Hicks and the Hot Licks. We were friends, and I was a fan and enjoyed watching the group perform. From the initial incarnation of the group, they were great! I saw them play in LA at the Troubadour, where they did a wonderful show. The audience loved them. It was hard to see how they could help but make it big right then!

 

But they managed. The group broke up, the original girls and some of the players left. They all got strung out. Dan soldiered on, and over the years he continued to find new players and singers, and with him at the center every iteration was terrific. He was a real character, and had a great sense of humor, but he didn’t always show it. He was understated and he could be hard to read at times. He could be funnily sarcastic and sardonic. One day in the 70s I was walking down 54th street in New York City and saw Dan walking in my direction. He saw me but looked the other way. So I did too. We just passed each other, neither saying a word or acknowledging the other at all. At times, that could be Dan for you.

 

When he drank, he could be dangerous. I bought his houseboat, the “Blue Goose,” sometime around 1969 down on Gate 5 in Sausalito. One day he visited me there, and drunkenly picked up a heavy ceramic toilet bowl and threatened to throw it down on me from the dock. At an attorney’s party one time, he threw all the potted plants over the second-floor porch rail. He got sick and the doctors told him to quit drinking. They warned him one more binge and your liver will give way and you’ll die. So he stopped drinking, and that was a good thing!

 

Over the years he had lots of hardcore fans, who loved his singing, his great songs, his swinging musical style, and his droll sense of humor. Endlessly creative, he developed custom shows, a musical history show, and country, jazz, and Christmas shows. All were presented with props he had personally created. He wore great outfits on stage. He sent out Christmas cards that he drew up every year and funny cards for tour notices announcing upcoming shows. Despite all the years I knew him, and all the shows I saw, I always looked forward to seeing him perform again. He worked up until the end.

 

I miss him.
