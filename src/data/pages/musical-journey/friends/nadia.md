Brian and I were looking for new singers after we had the big success with “Papa,” Nadia Finkelstein came and auditioned for us and we liked both her voice and her personality. Very smart, pretty, and a good sense of humor. We cut quite a few sides together that we thought came out well. We no sooner got the songs together on tape and started to take it around when Britney Spears had her first big hit. Suddenly teenagers were on all the rage in the music business. We weren’t able to get anyone interested, I never really understood why.
