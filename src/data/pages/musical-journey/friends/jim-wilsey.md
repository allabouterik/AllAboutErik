Jimmy was playing with Chris in the band Silvertone when I first met him. He previously played with the San Francisco group the Avengers. He was a unique and talented guitar stylist, using sounds and techniques that harkened back to the 1950s. He was a sweet and soft-spoken individual, rarely bubbling over with conversation. In the course of the years of recording with Chris, we became good friends. He had a wonderful talent of choosing just the right notes, chords, and lines to complement and amplify the sound and feeling of Chris’s work. He brought a lot of good ideas to the songs. He and Chris contemplated working together as a songwriting team. Jimmy was lending his inspiration to Isaak’s creative writing efforts. Chris offered him 5% of what they came up with. The offer left Jimmy cold.

 

He was a sensitive guy and seemed to become more so. As time went by he became more estranged from Chris. In the early days in the studio, when someone was overdubbing on one of his songs, Chris could cast major shade through the glass from the control room, looking dour and giving the player and me the fisheye. It’s spooked and flustered Jimmy. We worked out a system whereby Chris didn’t come to the studio when Jimmy was overdubbing. Jimmy and I would get everything set and ready to record, and then we went to dinner. He had exactly two glass of wine and when we returned to the studio, a couple tokes, low lighting, two or three takes and it was perfect. You can hear his beautiful playing on those records. But the schism between Chris and Jimmy kept growing.

 

He started using drugs and it suddenly seemed he couldn’t remember or concentrate on what he was doing. Or maybe he just didn’t care.  It was bad. I can’t remember whether he quit or was fired, but he left the group. It was sad for me personally, and musically, an obvious loss.

 

In the ensuing years I saw Jim in LA several times and we had nice times at lunch. I was invited over and met his gal Winter and little Waylon. Jimmy was recording some stuff but then he kind of went incommunicado. We talked on the phone several times but I never saw him again. I heard later he had a liver transplant, and after that, his health wasn’t good. He ultimately rejected the liver, was hospitalized, and died of a heart attack, only 61 years-old.

 

Way too young!
