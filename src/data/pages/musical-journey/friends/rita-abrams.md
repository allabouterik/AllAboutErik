One day Rita Abrams, a pretty gal I had previously met socially, approached me in a restaurant, said hi, and asked me if I would please to listen to a tape of a song she had written about Mill Valley, our hometown. She claimed that in high school she only had three albums, the Knoblick Upper 10,000, the Lovin Spoonful, and Tim Hardin. She obviously had very good taste.

 

She was a kindergarten teacher and had the concept of having her students sing along with her on the new song she had written. I loved the song and the concept, but I’d never recorded with a gal before, and much less a kindergarten class, but I agreed to give it a try. We took some equipment over to her classroom and recorded the song. The session wasn’t too encouraging. The little students couldn’t carry a tune. We decided to try and use third graders. They were pretty good, and we used the whole class, even though several of the boys really sang off key. I ended up putting them way over to one side and turning their mic off. They figured that trick out pretty quick, but I was the producer. When we finished, the record ended up sounding great!

 

The album cover photo shoot was tough. The kids kept wiggling around. And we were trying to get a shot of the whole class perched on one big chair. But Warners, and subsequently every easy listening radio programmer, as well as audiences around the world, loved the song. “Mill Valley” went number one in the adult contemporary genre. The group went on the Smothers Brothers show and was featured in Life Magazine. The record became the biggest seller in the history of Mill Valley as well! But unfortunately, overall we didn’t sell very many records. It turned out to be what they call a turntable hit. Another of our records was released as a single, but there was only one “Mill Valley”.

 

Rita’s been a great buddy ever since. She’s very funny and has cheered me on at times when my romances faltered. She has written some hilarious stage plays and lots of songs. It’s a tough way to make a living but with her talent and tenacity, Rita has managed to continue with her wonderful creative efforts.
