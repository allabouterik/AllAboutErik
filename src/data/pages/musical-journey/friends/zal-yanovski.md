I first met Zally on the road when the Knoblick Upper 10,000 played on the same bill as the Halifax 3. Zal was working as an accompanist for their group. You had the love the guy right away. He was zany, smart, fast, and funny. A year or so later back in New York City I teamed up with Zal, Denny Doherty, and later with Cass and we cut some sides together. John Sebastian and Zal met and hit it off big time. Along with Bob Cavallo, the four of us agreed to try and put a group together.

 

It worked out, and the rest is history. Zal’s inventive parts, his antics on stage, and his great guitar sounds were key in helping propel the group to stardom. He was always searching out the newest and latest guitar effects. But John always had to check his tuning.  I love his playing on “Coconut Grove”.



 He had a big heart but was always a semi madcap individual, and with his quick thinking and intelligence, at times he could be a very dangerous psychological guerrilla commentator.

 

He had a tortoise that was lost for a year in his backyard. Someone gave him a case of little figures made of a kind of jelly-like plastic, which he kept in his freezer. When guests came over, he put on little shows, taking a few out, and breaking off their arms, legs, and heads while they were still frozen. He gleefully stuck pins in them and melted their limbs with his lighter. Big fun Zally style!

 

He smoked two packs of strong cigarettes per day. He inhaled deeply and with gusto. He died way too young!
