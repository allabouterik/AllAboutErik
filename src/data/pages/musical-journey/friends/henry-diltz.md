My friendship with Henry started when we met as fellow banjo players at a rehearsal for a tour we were going out on called the Traveling Hootenanny. His group was the Modern Folk Quartette, MFQ for short, and mine was the Knoblick Upper 10,000. It was a long and brutal 40-day bus trip. We went North, South, East, and West, with only a couple of motel stops thrown in. In Boston, the auditorium was almost empty when we played. The backdrop said, “Dog Show 1932”. The most memorable occurrence on the trip for me, by far, was when the MFQ turned me on to pot for the first time. Mind blowing! 

A mildly noteworthy recollection of the tour concerns our girl folk singer, Lynn Gold, having a semi-emotional breakdown after having her guitar wrestled away from her and repossessed in SoCal, right on stage in the middle of her set. Couldn’t they have waited until she got off stage?

 

Henry and I both lived in New York City and shortly after our mutual groups split up, we shared an apartment at 97 McDougal Street in the Village. I was working with the Spoonful and we had our first hit going. Henry was at loose ends, no group and no career. He had a camera and I had the bright idea of throwing him a lifeline and hiring him to travel and take pictures with the Spoonful. A real job with a salary and per-diems! He took me up on the offer, and began taking photos. From those beginnings, he’s gone on to be considered a bonafide professional snapshot artist! In the mid-60s he planned to get married and decorated and furnished an apartment at 350 Bleecker Street, but the nuptials fell through. He gave me the apartment and moved to LA. I moved out of 97 McDougal.

 

We’ve stayed close over the years, hanging out in Laurel Canyon, LA, and visiting in San Francisco. I’ve stayed at his house down in North Hollywood hundreds of days over the ensuing years while working on projects down there. We’ve always had fun together and we’ve never had an argument. He just won’t go there! He’s taken so many photos of me, and like he has for so many others, helped document our lives. Now he’s a real big-wig photographer, in high demand, with shows and galleries and appearances on TV. As anyone who knows him will attest, he’s a one in a million-type guy. Funny, talented, and above all possessed of boundless optimism, patience, and good humor. He’s been a terrific buddy for over half a century.
