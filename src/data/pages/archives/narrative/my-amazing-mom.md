        Both had immigrated from Norway in 1906, when each was only 16 years
        old, and they met each other in Chicago. Both had come from the same
        little town back home. Marianne's mom had died giving birth to her, and
        Dietrich was the youngest son of Ole Pedersen, who had six kids with his
        first wife, who then died, and had six more with his second. Dietrich
        and Marianne had five kids together, the youngest of which was my mom.
        The family moved to Oak Park Illinois in 1916. My mom lived there for
        the rest of her life. She loved Oak Park.

      text: As a teenager my mom started off on the wrong foot with her dentist, doctor Earl Jacobsen, my future dad. He had suggested to Elsie's father that she get her braces reapplied and he'd agreed. My mom considered the braces the social ruination of her high school years. She went off to the University of Wisconsin, and after graduation she spent a semester studying in Norway.

      text: She graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1936. After college my mom worked as a telephone operator. She wasnâ€™t happy with her social life, and when her mom suggested attending a dance at the Country Club, she was unenthusiastic due to the lack of a suitable and exciting date. Her mom suggested she go with Doctor Jacobsen and with some reluctance she agreed. Apparently, they hit it off big time, because they began dating.
