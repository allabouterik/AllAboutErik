        Both had immigrated from Norway in 1906, when each was only 16 years
        old, and they met each other in Chicago. Both had come from the same
        little town back home. Marianne's mom had died giving birth to her, and
        Dietrich was the youngest son of Ole Pedersen, who had six kids with his
        first wife, who then died, and had six more with his second. Dietrich
        and Marianne had five kids together, the youngest of which was my mom.
        The family moved to Oak Park Illinois in 1916. My mom lived there for
        the rest of her life. She loved Oak Park.


        Here's little Elsie.
